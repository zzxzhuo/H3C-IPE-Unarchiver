Modified specifically to extract archived rootfs contained in Comware v7 system.bin

Tested platform:
* VAC1000 R5435P03
* WX2560H R5447P03

USAGE: python3 unarchive_ipe.py system.bin

==

The vendor implemented a fixed length (6520 bytes) header which specifies the filename
and size being archived in the blob at static offset 0x188C to 0x1978. A pseudo definition
looks like

 ---------------------------------------------
| filename | filesize | UNKNOWN |    tail?    |
|  224 B   |   4 B    |   4 B   |  0xffffffff |
 ---------------------------------------------

This structure is identical to what's being defined for IPE archives I discovered a
few years ago (refer to master branch).

The only difference being the rootfs package has an explicit filename "mpu.cpio.gz".
